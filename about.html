        <h1> Welcome to TThe About Me Page</h2>
        <p> I am a freshmen in The University of Rhode Island's Mechanical Engineering program.
        I am currently a double major in Mechanical Engineering and French with a minor in Computer Science.
        This entire webpage was created in html script that I learned off Khan Academy. 
        I aspire to become an engineer that focuses in Mechatronics and thus I am taking this introductory computer science course in order to help build the required coding skill to achieve my goal.
        I enjoy a vast variety of hobbies including but not limited to cooking, reading, video games, building, and sports.
